Emergent properties are crucial for biological systems. In tissues, cells react to a complex environment in ways that exceed the sum of responses to individual variables.  Understanding these emergent behaviors remains challenging. We developed LinSig, a computational package to rigorously identify epistatic interactions in transcriptomic responses by leveraging logic deconvolution and empirical nonparametric statistics.  An interactive web interface facilitates dissection of complex cellular responses across signals, genetic perturbation, and cell-cell interactions.
